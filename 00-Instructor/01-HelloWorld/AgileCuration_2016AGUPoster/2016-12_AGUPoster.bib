  abstract = {Enterprise Integration Patterns provides an invaluable catalog of sixty-five patterns, with real-world solutions that demonstrate the formidable of messaging and help you to design effective messaging solutions for your enterprise.The authors also include examples covering a variety of different integration technologies, such as JMS, MSMQ, TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, Microsoft BizTalk, SOAP, and XSL. A case study describing a bond trading system illustrates the patterns in practice, and the book offers a look at emerging standards, as well as insights into what the future of enterprise integration might hold.This book provides a consistent vocabulary and visual notation framework to describe large-scale integration solutions across many technologies. It also explores in detail the advantages and limitations of asynchronous messaging architectures. The authors present practical advice on designing code that connects an application to a messaging system, and provide extensive information to help you determine when to send a message, how to route it to the proper destination, and how to monitor the health of a messaging system. If you want to know how to manage, monitor, and maintain a messaging system once it is in use, get this book.},

  isbn = {978-0-321-66963-6},
  shorttitle = {Service {{Design Patterns}}},
  abstract = {Web services have been used for many years. In this time, developers and architects have encountered a number of recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have learned that certain service design approaches work better than others to solve certain problems. In Service Design Patterns, Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions for web services that follow the REST architectural style or leverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies the fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common design patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context in which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements, and explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples are provided to help you better understand how the patterns work but are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be applied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in the years to come. This book will help readers answer the following questions: How do you create a web service API, what are the common API styles, and when should a particular style be used? How can clients and web services communicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex conversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended periods of time? What are the options for implementing web service logic, and when should a particular approach be used? How can clients become less coupled to the underlying systems used by a service? How can information about a web service be discovered? How can generic functions like authentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on the client or service? What changes to a service cause clients to break? What are the common ways to version a service? How can web services be designed to support the continuing evolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly upgrade? This book is an invaluable resource for enterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use web services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or open source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products that leverage emerging Cloud platforms.},

After a discussion of patterns methodology, reasons for using design patterns, the book delves into each of the 23 patterns. Each pattern section gives a detailed description of the pattern, refactored from either Boolean logic or simpler, less-maintainable code that you might encounter in the real world, and shows readers how to use the pattern in their code. The text walks readers through making the move from current code to the pattern, lists the benefits of using the pattern, and shows how the pattern performs after the refactoring effort, with a goal throughout of providing practical implementations.},

Drawing on their extensive enterprise development experience, the authors clearly show how to deliver on the promise of a patterns-based approach\textemdash{}and consistently create higher-quality solutions faster, with fewer resources. Lee Ackerman and Celso Gonzalez demonstrate how Patterns-Based Engineering (PBE) can help you systematically overcome common obstacles to success with patterns. By bringing discipline and clarity to patterns usage, their techniques enable you to replicate your success broadly and scale patterns to even the largest projects. The authors introduce powerful ways to discover, design, create, package, and consume patterns based on your organization's experience and best practices. They also present extensive coverage of the nontechnical aspects of making patterns work, including a full chapter of guidance on clearing up misconceptions that stand in your way. Coverage includes Using patterns to optimize the entire development lifecycle, including design, coding, testing, and deploymentSystematically managing the risks and economic returns associated with patternsEffectively implementing PBE roles, tasks, work products, and toolsIntegrating PBE with existing development processes, including eXtreme Programming, Scrum, and OpenUPUsing Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) with patterns Whether you're an architect, designer, developer, analyst, project manager, or process engineer, Patterns-Based Engineering will help you to consistently derive greater business value and agility from patterns.},

  abstract = {In data modeling, product information has most often been handled separately from process information. The integration of product and process models in a unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared between High Energy Physics (HEP) groups throughout the system lifecycle from design through to production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures through the CRISTAL project and reveals where existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process models, where patterns are missing or require enrichment for integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and Workflow Management (WfM) models through a common meta-model.},
