The
<h1>
Latin American Collections at the University of New Mexico (UNM), in partnership with the
<h2>
Fideicomiso Archivo Plutarco Elías Calles and Fernando Torreblanca (FAPECFT), request $15,000 to support the first year of an expansion (Phase II) of an international bilingual digitization/open access and discovery project which makes physical documents held at the
<h2>
FAPECFT available in a publically accessible platform. These documents are also discoverable in Spanish and English through any public search engine. If awarded,
<h3>
LARRP funding will enable the first annual acquisition of 52,000 (toward a total of 156,000) digitalized surrogates that will be described and uploaded into an openly accessible UNM platform, which will be linked to CRL. These documents with Spanish and English metadata will be added to the three year project currently in process, which includes the Fondos Alvaro Obregon (66,000 documents), Fernando Torreblanca (22,000) and Plutarco Elias Calles (88,000 documents). The completion of this proposed second phase will expand dissemination and discovery of 332,000 historical documents, outpacing Latin American archival offerings in high priced subscription databases and – most importantly –asserting a shared commitment among
<h3>
<p>LARRP members to open and equitable archival access in Latin America and the US.</p>
