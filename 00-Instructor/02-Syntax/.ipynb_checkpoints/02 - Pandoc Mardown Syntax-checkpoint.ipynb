    "# Pandoc Markdown Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandoc supports a large number of input file formats for processing (including markdown, reStructuredText, textile, HTML, DocBook, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode, Txt2Tags, Microsoft Word docx, LibreOffice ODT, EPUB, or Haddock markup) into a vast number of output formats. For our purposes in this workshop we will focus on working with the extended markdown syntax supported by Pandoc as a language for creating content and generating multiple output representations. \n",

    "## Title Block and Additional Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandoc provides an option for providing document metadata in two forms: as a simple `title block` at the beginning of a document, and also as a `YAML` metadata block that you can provide anywhere in the document, or even as an externally referenced document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `title block` provides basic title, author, and date information about the document that is used by many of the default Pandoc templates to automatically fill in specific document elements. For example, the `title` provided in the title block is used to set the `title` meta element in a generated HTML file and for a `title` block in a LaTeX document. The authorship and date information is similarly used to automatically generate content for some output document types. The `title block` has a simple three part structure, each of which is required if a `title block` if a subsequent element is used. The format of a title block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "% title\n",
    "% author(s) (separated by semicolons)\n",
    "% date (treated as a text string)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "These elements (and any others that you would like to create and use) may also be placed in a `YAML` metadata block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: title\n",
    "author: author(s) (separated by semicolons)\n",
    "date: date (treated as a text string)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why would you use a `YAML` metadata block?* - additional metadata can be very useful for setting variable values that Pandoc uses when generating documents (such as specifying a bibliography file to use), or values that can be referred to within custom document templates (such as in the conference poster example provided in the [introduction](../01-HelloWorld/01%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Pandoc.ipynb)."

    "\n",
    "The section of the Pandoc User's Guide relating to headers can be found [here](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key element of any document that you create is the hierarchical structure representing the document outline. This hierarchy is used to deliniate content sections and the styles used to present the content of those sections. Examples of the use of the outline structure include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* mapping of the hierarchy levels into corresponding HTML header elements - `<h1>`, `<h2>`,`<h3>`, etc.\n",
    "* defining chapters and sections of generated PDF files\n",
    "* defining title slides, slides and slide content for slide shows\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining the outline structure of your documents focus on the structure and not intended representation of your content. Other elements of the markdown syntax can be used to create effects like emphasys or strong emphasys, and additional options are available through very granular control that you can exercise through customized templates (e.g. for HTML and LaTeX generated PDF files) and CSS (for HTML and EPubs) stylesheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of options for specifying outline levels:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Level One\n",

    "\n",
    "A Level Two Header\n",
    "------------------\n",

    "How youre selected header levels are rendered will depend upon the template and format used when translating the markdown into a specific representation. \n",

    "Note: while standard markdown allows for having no empty line before a header, Pandoc required a blank line before a header. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Header Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specific optional header attributes as part of your document. These attributes can be used to assign `id` and `class` values to headers that can be used when creating custom HTML styles, provide labels used in automatically generated Table of Contents content, and other output-format-specific elements. The attributes for a header are specified using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The section of the Pandoc User's Guide relating to paragraphs can be found [here](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#paragraphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for paragraphs is very simple - just blocks of text separated from each other by blank lines. By default line breaks will be ignored so you can type your paragraph as multiple (contiguous) lines and expect it to be rendered as a single paragraph in the output representation. Paragraph breaks are automatically created when a blank line is encountered at the end of a block of contiguous lines of text. \n",

    "### Block Quotes\n",

    "The section of the Pandoc User's Guide relating to block quotes can be found [here](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#block-quotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Block quotes are defined through the use of the `>` character at the beginning of the text that is intended for inclusion in the block quote. The `>` may appear at the start of each line, or a *lazy* may be used in which only the first line of a block of contiguous text lines is preceeded by a `>`. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "A variety of list types are supported by Pandoc, including nesting of lists of different types. Nesting is defined through the use of four spaces or one tab to indent the list item. Individual list items may contain multiple paragraphs (each separated by a blank line) and preceeded by *four spaces*. Because of the indentation rule for multi-paragraph list items, `code blocks` included in a list item must be indented *eight spaces*. These lists include:\n",
