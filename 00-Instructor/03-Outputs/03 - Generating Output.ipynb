    "\n",

Some key options are provided here, but refer to the [general writer options](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-writer-options) and the [format-specific writer options](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options-affecting-specific-writers) sections of the user's guide for a complete listing of options. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `-t` or `--template=FILE`\n",
    "\n",
    "This option enables the specification of a non-default template for the generation of the output file. Custom templates may be developed that provide highly specialized or  differentiated structure and presentation for the output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandoc --template=default.latex -s -o 01_DataManagement.pdf 01_DataManagement.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command would generate an output PDF file named `01_DataManagement.pdf` based on a custom template named `default.latex` (which is located in this case in the same directory as the source markdown and output files). \n",
    "\n",
    "### `--toc` or `--table-of-contents`\n",
    "\n",
    "This option will have Pandoc automatically generate a table of contents at the beginning of the output document that reflects the outline structure of the document. The `--toc-depth=NUMBER` option may be used with this option to specify the depth of the outline elements to include in the table of contents. The default TOC depth is three (i.e. the first three outline levels will be included if the `--toc` option is not supplied). \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandoc --toc --toc-depth=1 -s -o OILS515_syllabus.html OILS515_syllabus.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will generate a table of contents that includes only the level one sections at the beginning of the generated HTML file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `--self-contained` (for HTML output)\n",
    "\n",
    "This option is useful when you are generating one of the HTML formats where you don't want the generated file to include external dependencies - for example external javascript or image files. This option will include all of the items included by reference within the document within the generated file, allowing for higher portability of the resulting self-contained file. \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandoc --standalone --self-contained -t dzslides -o 01_DataManagement.slides.html 01_DataManagement.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will generate a single HTML file that represents all of the javascript code and content (including images) that were specified as part of the slide show. Without the `--self-contained` option the slide show would consist of multiple files representing the *common* structure of a web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `-c URL` or  `--css=URL` (for HTML output)\n",
    "\n",
    "This option allows you to specify one or more CSS stylesheets that should be referenced within the generated output file to customize the styling of the content of these files. This allows for a powerful level of customization for otherwise generic HTML output. \n",
    "\n",
    "`pandoc -c lobo_slides.css  --standalone -t dzslides -o 01_DataManagement.slides.html 01_DataManagement.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command would include the `lobo_slides.css` file by reference in the generated HTML slide show allowing for very localized and targeted styling of individual elements within the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `--reference-docx=FILE` (for DOCX output)\n",
    "\n",
    "This option allows you to refer to a separate DOCX file that has been styled using the styles you would like used in the output DOCX file. This does not use the referenced as a full template, but instead essentially reads the style information out of the file and adds that style information into the newly generated output file. This enables the relatively limited support that Pandoc has for custom DOCX templating.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandoc --reference-docx=myDocx.docx -o newDocx.docx newFile.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command would generate an output DOCX file based on the provided markdown file that has the *common* styles tranferred from the referenced `myDocx.docx` file. "
